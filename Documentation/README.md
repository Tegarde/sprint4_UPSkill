<br>


>The Green'it system is a Reddit like experience for the green and eco-friendly enthusiasts.  
> The system allows users to create posts, comments, and interact with other users' posts and comments.  
> These posts can also be filtered by category, and users can view the most popular posts and comments.  
> If a moderator disapproves a post, he can deactivate it, and it will be invisible in the system.  
> The moderator can also create events, for example, a hackathon or a conference, for the users to attend.  
> The users and the moderators can also receive badges based on their interactions and contributions, respectively.  
> The system also allows users to add posts to their favorites, and view their favorite posts.  
> Finally, the system also allows users to view interaction notifications for their posts, so they can stay updated with the latest activity.
